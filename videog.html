        <p>This decade would see Canada’s policies being overhauled by then-premier Piere Trudeau. While last decade saw the Points System being introduced to combat discrimination, this decade Trudeau would announce that Canada will begin to embrace multiculturalism. This led to Canada beginning to value diversity as the Canadian identity itself and many institutions began changing their policies and mindset to match that diversity in the population.
        </p>
        <p>While there were good things being put into legislation, there was something brewing in Quebec. The Front de liberation de Quebec (FLQ) group began to take a more violent strategy in order to receive their demands. They wanted Quebec to separate itself from Canada and hated English speakers. They would bomb their businesses and homes. During this decade they would kidnap two members of parliament and eventually kill one of them. This led to the use of the War Measures Acts and heavy policing of Quebec in order to find those that associated themselves with this terrorist group. After some negotiating things would later fizzle out but this remained the first major instance of home-grown terrorism in Canada.
        </p>
        <p> Environmentalism and anti-war protests would start catching the wind in many countries as the Cold War continued to ravage on, especially in the Vietnam War. Earth Day would begin to be celebrated during this decade and environmentalism became a movement that only grew later on. Feminism would be in full force with the women’s liberation movement spearheading all the other major organizations.

        <p>Fashion continued to piggyback off the hippie movement with the continuation of bell bottoms but also the addition of suits. Many women would begin wearing suits as a sense of fashion and empowerment. Long straight hair for both sexes became the preferred style, with essentially no jewelry. In the art industry, photography would begin to be wildly considered a new form of art, heavily due to the newfound popularity of the digital camera. Graffiti would also start to be accepted as art in some major circles, even though it is frowned upon originally.
        </p>
        <p>In the music industry, it would be dominated by Fleetwood Mac, Aerosmith, Elton John and the legendary band Queen. Rock and roll would claim a strong grasp on the charts during this decade. Queen was so influential that their song “We Will Rock You” began to start a trend of music incorporated into sports. This trend would never fade away and both are still connected to each other today.
        </p>
        <p>Star Wars, Rocky and The Godfather would premiere and would go on to be some of the most successful film franchises of all time. While people were advocating for peace, these violence-filled movies would be beloved by all and win countless awards.

        <p>This decade truly was the biggest jump towards the digital age. The first intel programmable processor was commercially sold, marking the first step toward modern-day computers. The first-ever email was sent in 1971. The Apple II would be created and kickstarted Apple into later being the most high-value company in the world.
        </p>
        <p>With music listening at an all-time high, the Walkman was released and revolutionized the listening experience. The first digital camera was released by Kodak, which would influence pop culture forever. NASA launched the Voyager Sattelites into space, which remain there, still in use. Microcomputers began to be sold in stores around North America, marking the beginning of the move toward smartphones and other portable microcomputer devices. The first GPS was also developed
