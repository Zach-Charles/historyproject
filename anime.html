        <p>After WWII, the USSR and US became superpowers and basically had a chokehold on the world with their nuclear weapons. This led to a global Cold War, which caused proxy wars everywhere and saw the UN attempting to prevent the nuclear destruction of the entire world. Places like Korea had wars that were heavily backed by the USSR and the US on opposing sides, without both countries actually fighting head-on.
        </p>
        <p> They would support different countries in these wars instead of confronting each other because of mutually assured destruction. This concept meant that a full-scale nuclear war would only end in the destruction of both nations and no one would come out as a survivor. While this started in this decade, it would persist through the 70s.
        </p>
        <p>In the US, the Civil Rights movement began as African-American figures gained more and more influence and strength to protest against the policies of segregation. This would also occur in Canada, with a large push for desegregation in schools across the nation. Sadly, many of these freedoms would not be achieved for another decade.

        <p>With the widespread availability of TVs, shows like the Twilight Zone, I Love Lucy and many other shows became insanely popular. Hollywood exploded and stars like James Dean, Marilyn Monroe and Frank Sinatra influenced their genres in ways that would last to our current generation of media. While the introduction of TVs in homes brought down viewership in theatres, films would begin to sell rights to broadcasters so families would begin to watch them from the comfort of their own homes.
        </p>
        <p>Music began experiencing the birth of rock and roll. Musicians such as Chuck Berry and Little Richard would gain popularity but neither would ever reach the heights of Elvis Presley. While Elvis practically stole his style from these musicians, he would be considered the face of rock and roll as it birthed onto the music scene.
        </p>
        <p>Sports would start to push athletes that became household names. These names include Jim Brown, Mickey Mantle and Hank Aaron. Newly integrated MLB prospered in this decade. Boxing and Football were massive among viewers and brought in a lot of viewers. The major leagues of MLB, NHL, NFL and NBA would expand to accommodate more athletes and higher viewership.

        <p>As talked about in the section above, TVs became widespread within the homes of many people at this time. While it was already invented a while ago, it became affordable for the everyday person to use instead of just the rich elite. Colour TV was introduced also later on in this decade, but would not catch on until a little while later. Tape recorders became prevalent and revolutionized the way how films and other forms of media were recorded.
        </p>
        <p>The Space Race, a byproduct of the cold war, showed just how far humanity could push the limits of technology into the bounds of outer space. The Moon landing would occur next decade, but there were still many advances in technology in this decade that painted the way for that to happen. Computers would also be invented but, like colour TV, would not be widely available until decades later.
