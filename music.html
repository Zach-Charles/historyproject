        <p>TIn the 1960s, Canada would start to broaden its social safety net with more and more programs. The Canadian Pension Plan was instated in 1965 as a mandatory investment fund that would help pay for those after they retire or reach 65 years of age. The Medical Care Act of 1966 would turn Tommy Douglas’ medical-care-for-all policy in Saskatchewan into a policy for the entire country.
        </p>
        <p>This would also be the same decade where Canada’s government strived to remove discrimination from the immigration system. In 1962, there would be a direct reform that aimed to allow anyone that was unsponsored and met the necessary criteria, could be allowed in regardless of race, skin colour, or ethnic origin. 5 years later, they would remove the sponsor system entirely and enact the point system. This would assign points in a bunch of categories about the potential immigrant that would need to be above 50 in order for them to be let into the country.
        </p>
        <p>Sadly, during this decade, Canada would partake in the large-scale removal of  Indigenous children and place them into homes of majority white, non-indigenous, and middle-class families across Canada. This was known as the 60s Scoop. This would cause indigenous children to lose their cultural identity and force them to assimilate into white Canadian culture. Many of these children would never know they were indigenous at all or even who their parents were.

        <p>For music, this decade would possibly be the most influential decade in the industry of all time. The 60s saw the domination of major artists such as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Pink Floyd and more. These figures would respectively change their genres and still remain prominent musical artists that have withstood the test of time.
        </p>
        <p>TV would set itself up for success for many years to come. The Batman Series, Startrek and the Flintstones would all begin airing and changing the landscape of their respective genres. These shows remain memorable and adored even to this day.

        </p>
        <p> The Hippie Movement became extremely popular among the young and old. Bell bottoms, tye-die and paisley prints became widespread in the fashion industry. Men and women would wear dresses and these other articles of clothing while embracing the movement of peace and prosperity.

        <p>The Apollo 11 Moon landing was finally achieved in this decade. It would mark the biggest achievement of humanity in space at the time. At the same time, the first supercomputer was built and used. It would be the first piece of technology that would utilize megaflops as a form of data. Intel would form this decade and become one of the top manufacturers of everyday and high-end processing chips and other forms of computer parts.
        </p>
        <p>Medicinal technology would see leaps and bounds as well. The vaccine for measles would be approved and changed how vaccines were administered to other diseases and helped open the doors for them. The first-ever birth-control pill began selling during this decade and was one of the first signs of freedom among women in their sexual lives. The first-ever heart transplant occurred in 1967.
        </p>
        <p>The first-ever network for computers was created during this decade, paving the way for the actual internet in the following years. Video game consoles began to see manufacturing, but they would not become widespread until around the 80s. LEDs and Lasers finally became a reality after decades of research and development as well.
